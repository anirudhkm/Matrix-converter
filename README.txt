This project deals with 3 phase to 3 phase matrix converter which was done by me along with Aparajith Sreedharan and Badri Narayanan.

The idea of the project is to input 3-phase supply from wind sources, where we can experience variable frequency and voltage. 

This input is fed to the matrix converter, so as to get an output with constant frequency and voltage which can synchronized with a power grid.

This really makes a great impact in utilizing renewable energy sources.

Please read the Final_report.pdf for more explanation on the work.
